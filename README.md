# digitalnet

Digital nets is a construction of quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) point set.
This library provides the basic operation on digital nets:
* construct a digital net by uniform random independent choice of its basis
* do QMC integration of a function by a [digitally shifted] digital net
* apply a digital shift to a given digital net
* save a [digitally shifted] digital net to string
* load a [digitally shifted] digital net from string

## examples
/examples directory contains some simple applications, each of which is provided as a simple dub package.

## coming soon
* linear scrambling
